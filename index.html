  <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
  <p><strong>Effective Date:</strong> July 27, 2025</p>

  <h2>1. Personal Data</h2>
  <p>We do not collect your personal data directly (name, address, email, phone number, etc.).</p>

  <h2>2. Local Data Storage</h2>
  <p>We use Unity’s <code>PlayerPrefs</code> to store game settings, progress, high scores, and ad preferences. These data:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>are stored locally on your device;</li>
    <li>are never transmitted to remote servers;</li>
    <li>include:
      <ul>
        <li>your score, high score, and current game state;</li>
        <li>daily rewarded‐ad counts and timestamps (for limiting ad frequency);</li>
        <li>the “Under 16” or “Over 16” age gate selection;</li>
        <li>your choice of personalized vs. non‑personalized ads;</li>
        <li>the completion status of the Google UMP consent flow.</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
  </ul>

  <h2>3. Gameplay Data Collection</h2>
  <p>The app records only technical events necessary for gameplay mechanics and UI:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>your current score;</li>
    <li>the number of consecutive successful hits (combo count);</li>
    <li>the moment of “defeat” to trigger the rewarded‑ad prompt.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>These data are used solely within the app to manage and display gameplay.</p>

  <h2>4. Advertising and Third‑Party SDKs</h2>
  <p>We use <strong>Google AdMob</strong> along with Google UMP (User Messaging Platform) to display ads and obtain consent in the EEA, UK, and Switzerland.</p>
  <p>AdMob may automatically collect the following anonymous data:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>device IP address;</li>
    <li>Advertising ID;</li>
    <li>ad interaction data (clicks, impressions);</li>
    <li>approximate geolocation (based on IP);</li>
    <li>technical details of your device (model, OS version).</li>
  </ul>
  <p>We do not receive these data in a form that can personally identify you.</p>
  <p>Learn more: <a href="https://policies.google.com/privacy" target="_blank">Google Privacy Policy</a></p>

  <h2>5. Rewarded Video Ads</h2>
  <p>After a defeat, you may choose to watch a rewarded video ad to continue your game with the same score. Upon watching:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>the game resumes from the defeat point;</li>
    <li>your score is preserved;</li>
    <li>no further rewarded‑ad offer is made in that session.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>6. Advertising Consent (EEA, UK, Switzerland)</h2>
  <p>On first launch, users in the EEA, UK, and Switzerland are prompted via Google UMP to choose:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>personalized ads;</li>
    <li>non‑personalized (contextual) ads.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>Your choice is saved locally and applied via the <code>npa=1</code> parameter for non‑personalized requests. You can change this selection at any time through the consent‑flow UI or by clearing the app data.</p>

  <h2>7. Ad Frequency Limits</h2>
  <p>To avoid ad fatigue, we enforce limits on rewarded‑video ads:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>maximum of 10 rewarded videos per day;</li>
    <li>minimum interval of 1 minute between videos;</li>
    <li>no more than one rewarded video per game session.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>These counters and timers are stored locally (<code>PlayerPrefs</code>) and are not transmitted.</p>

  <h2>8. Children</h2>
  <p>The app does not knowingly collect personal information from children under 13 years old (or the minimum age in your country). Users under 13 only see non‑personalized ads, in compliance with Google Play’s family policies.</p>

  <h2>9. Permissions</h2>
  <p>The app does not request access to the camera, microphone, contacts, or precise location.</p>

  <h2>10. Managing Ad Preferences</h2>
  <p>You can disable personalized ads at the device level:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Android: Settings → Google → Ads → Opt out of personalized ads;</li>
    <li>iOS: Settings → Privacy → Apple Advertising → Limit Ad Tracking.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>Or visit <a href="https://adssettings.google.com" target="_blank">Google Ads Settings</a>.</p>

  <h2>11. Security</h2>
  <p>We take reasonable measures to protect locally stored data. However, any data transmission (e.g., fetching ads) carries inherent technical risks and cannot be guaranteed 100 % secure.</p>
